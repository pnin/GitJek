    "snippet": "After being hosted on GitHub Pages for &gt;2 years, this site is now Powered by WordPress. I had not planned to make this shift so soon, as building with Jekyll was simple and nothing can beat the performance of a static site.This website is currently operating at a $40 loss YoY from domain name renewal. and WP hosting charges. (No plan to monetize the site either ‚Äì Ads/Subscription)An archive of all previous posts would be hosted on my GitHub.io soon (my weekend project).Update (7 Jun, 2022) ‚Äì Moved the blog from pratiknilange.in to pratik.nl. So there goes another $20/yr. I should seriously refrain from buying any more domains ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.Update (30 Oct, 2022) - You can say that this site is back to the pavilion. The lack of basic customization and unavailability of good themes made this reverse shit from WP to GP a no-brainer. Also the pricing mess they got into early this year makes me wonder how the future and direction of their products will be. Gutenberg isn‚Äôt making things good either, I miss my early blogging days on the classic editor and how I was absolutely in love with it. The block editor for themes is easily one of the most buggy piece of software I have come across in the recent past. Hope they fix it soon and come out with a healthy revival plan for the lost user base. Now coming to the details of this site, it is primarily built in HTML and Markdown. Preprocessed by Jekyll. It‚Äôs hosted on Github and distributed globally by Cloudflare."

    "snippet": "I turned 19 this Summer (March to be precise) and I was up for a driving license test. I don‚Äôt know about it in other countries, but here in India it‚Äôs a serious business and you got to have pretty good driving skills to pass this test (unless you have a fixer). For non-transport vehicles, there are two variants of this test: A two-wheeler license test (For Motorcycle with Gear) and a Four-Wheeler License (For Cars). To ease up things a little, we consider driving a bike or a car whose dimensions and capacity are, you know, smaller compared to the ones we drive on road.The deadly serpentine track consists of some really steep (geometrical disaster) turns which can surely give you a twinge in the ass (while driving a bike of course).  Now out of curiosity or utter stupidity, my choice of bike was a Royal Enfield Classic.Talking about its dimensions, the bike is about 2.2 meters long (7.3ft), 0.8 meters wide (2.2ft). Fortunately, it has a power start.    Yes, I had to stick an ugly learner's sign on the front and back sides of the bike.Fast-forward to the result, I can say that I survived the test. It was an automobile-miracle that I could drive this beast and pass the test. For the people who are reading this post and are planning to pass the license test on this bike, I would like to tell them one thing, ‚ÄúDarr ke aage Jeet Hain‚Äù."
