I")<p>After being hosted on GitHub Pages for &gt;2 years, this site is now Powered by WordPress. I had not planned to make this shift so soon, as building with Jekyll was simple and nothing can beat the performance of a static site.</p>

<p>This website is currently operating at a $40 loss YoY from domain name renewal. and WP hosting charges. (No plan to monetize the site either – Ads/Subscription)</p>

<p>An archive of all previous posts would be hosted on my GitHub.io soon (my weekend project).</p>

<p>Moved the blog from <a href="https://pratiknilange.in">pratiknilange.in</a> to <a href="https://pratik.nl">pratik.nl</a>. So there goes another $20/yr. I should seriously refrain from buying any more domains 🤦🏼‍♂️.</p>

<p>And the site is back to pavilion 🦗. Coming to the details, it is primarily built in HTML and Markdown. Preprocessed by Jekyll. It’s hosted on Github, protected and distributed globally by Cloudflare ⚡.</p>
