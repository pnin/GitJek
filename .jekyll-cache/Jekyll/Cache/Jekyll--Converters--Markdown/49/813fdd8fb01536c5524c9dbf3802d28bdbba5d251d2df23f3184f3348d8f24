I"M<p>One of the best movies of 2022! Action-packed, outstanding cinematography. Missed a lot of references though, because I haven’t watched the first instalment (Yeah, big mistake. I should’ve watched it). Cannot believe that two movies were shot 36 years apart. Tom Cruise sure is still at the top of his game. A solid 8/10!</p>
