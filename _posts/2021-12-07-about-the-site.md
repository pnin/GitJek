After being hosted on GitHub Pages for >2 years, this site is now Powered by WordPress. I had not planned to make this shift so soon, as building with Jekyll was simple and nothing can beat the performance of a static site.

This website is currently operating at a $40 loss YoY from domain name renewal. and WP hosting charges. (No plan to monetize the site either – Ads/Subscription)

An archive of all previous posts would be hosted on my GitHub.io soon (my weekend project).

### Update (7 Jun, 2022)
Moved the blog from <a href="https://pratiknilange.in">pratiknilange.in</a> to <a href="https://pratik.nl">pratik.nl</a>. So there goes another $20/yr. I should seriously refrain from buying any more domains 🤦🏼‍♂️.

### Update (30 Oct, 2022)
And the site is back to pavilion 🦗. Coming to the details, it is primarily built in HTML and Markdown. Preprocessed by Jekyll. It's hosted on Github, protected and distributed globally by Cloudflare ⚡.
