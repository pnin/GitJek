After being hosted on GitHub Pages for >2 years, this site is now Powered by WordPress. I had not planned to make this shift so soon, as building with Jekyll was simple and nothing can beat the performance of a static site.

This website is currently operating at a $40 loss YoY from domain name renewal. and WP hosting charges. (No plan to monetize the site either ‚Äì Ads/Subscription)

An archive of all previous posts would be hosted on my GitHub.io soon (my weekend project).

### Update (7 Jun, 2022)
Moved the blog from <a href="https://pratiknilange.in">pratiknilange.in</a> to <a href="https://pratik.nl">pratik.nl</a>. So there goes another $20/yr. I should seriously refrain from buying any more domains ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### Update (30 Oct, 2022)
You can say that this site is back to the pavilion. The lack of basic customization and unavailability of good themes made this reverse shit from WP to GP a no-brainer. Also the pricing mess they got into early this year makes me wonder how the future and direction of their products will be. Gutenberg isn't making things good either, I miss my early blogging days on the classic editor and how I was absolutely in love with it. The block editor for themes is easily one of the most buggy piece of software I have come across in the recent past. Hope they fix it soon and come out with a healthy revival plan for the lost user base. Now coming to the details of this site, it is primarily built in HTML and Markdown. Preprocessed by Jekyll. It's hosted on Github and distributed globally by Cloudflare.
